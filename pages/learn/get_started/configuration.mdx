# Configuration

## 1: Authentication

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">Don't have an API key? Get one here!</Callout>

First, you need to initialize the **SnippylyProvider** with a client authentication token. If you don't have one, go ahead and [visit our website]() to sign up! Insert the **SnipplyProvider** in the root of your application.

```js
import { SnippylyProvider } from '@snippyly/react';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <SnippylyProvider apiKey="...">
      <App />
    </SnippylyProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

The `SnippylyProvider` acts as a [React context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), so you can only use the **Snippyly Client** within its context.

## 2: Using the Snippyly Client

The `@snippyly/react` package provides a convenient hook `useSnippylyClient` to provision the SDK client. Here's how you can use it in a React component:

```js
import { useSnippylyClient } from '@snippyly/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useSnippylyClient();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is some component!</>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 3: Identifying your Users

Snippyly needs to know who is logged in to your application! This is so we can accurately provide cursors, presence, comments, etc.

### General Implementation

Everyone handles authentication differently in their applications, so there isn't a one size fits all solution. Here's a general implementation, but the main point is that _when the user is logged in_, you should also identify the user with the **Snippyly** client.

```js
import { useSnippylyClient } from '@snippyly/react';

function LoginComponent() {

  const { client } = useSnippylyClient();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is some login component!</>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Example with Firebase Authentication

Here's a specific example using Firebase Authentication:

```js

import { useSnippylyClient } from '@snippyly/react';

function LoginComponent() {

  const { client } = useSnippylyClient();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is some login component!</>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 4: Tracking the User

Lastly, Snippyly needs to know what part of your app the user is currently on! **Documents** and **Locations** are how you can provide that information.

### Document

A **Document** is like a _Building_. Users in the same building can find eachother, but they cannot interact in real-time until they are in the same **Location**. A **Document** can be represented with a string identifier.

Here, we will set our **Document ID**, which is like setting the address of the building that the current user is in. _In this example_, I have a React component that where I want to implement some Snippyly features.

```js

```

### Location

A **Location** is like a _Room_. Users in the same room can talk to eachother, see eachother, and interact in real-time! They can be represented by any JSON object.

### Setting the Document ID

Well what happens when your user leaves the _Building_? 

### Setting the Location
