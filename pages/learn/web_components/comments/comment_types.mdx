# Comment Types

_There are two types of contextual comments_

---

## 1. Element-based comments:

> _**Like Figma, but better**_

This enables your end-users to attach a comment pin to any DOM element. If the DOM element moves, the comment pin moves with the DOM element. If the DOM element is removed, the pin is removed from the DOM. 

**Example**

## 2. Text-based comments:

> _**Like Google Docs**_

This is Google Docs style comments. **Once you enable this**, your end-users can select any text and attach a comment to it. If the selected text moves, the comment moves with it or if the text is removed the comment is also removed from the DOM.
