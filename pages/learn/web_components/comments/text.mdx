# Text-based comments

_Show Google Docs type text comments._

---

{/* <Comment style="margin-top: 2.5rem" user={"Rachel"} documentId={commentDocumentId} height={500}/> */}

## When to use

If you want to display Google Docs style text comments, you can use our client APIs to enable that feature easily.

## How to use

### Enable text based commenting

<Callout type="info"> **Note:** Learn about what text based commenting is [here]()</Callout>

Text based comments are disabled by default. You can enable them using the client API:

```js copy
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.enableTextComments(true);
```

**Example**

```tsx copy {8-21} showLineNumbers
import React, {useEffect} from "react";
import { useSnippylyClient } from '@snippyly/react';

const SomeComponent = () => {
  
  const { client } = useSnippylyClient();


  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      enableTextComments();
    }
  }, [client]);

  const enableTextComments = () => {
    if (client) {
      const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
      commentElement.enableTextComments(true);
    }
  }

  
  return (
    //... rest of the component code...
  )
}

export default SomeComponent;
```

### Enable stream mode

You can enable stream mode to show comment dialog boxes on the right side similar to Google Docs (vs contextual floating dialog boxes).

To enable stream mode, you can call this method with parameter `true`. To disable it again, you can call this method with parameter `false`.

**Example**

```js copy
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.enableStreamMode(true);
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that you move the `<SnippylyComments>` tag as a **sibling of the target content** -  inside whichever DOM element is getting scrolled so that the comment stream also scrolls.
- Optionally, you could also pass the DOM id of the scrolling element to help us position the comments more accurately:

**Example**

```html copy
<SnippylyComments stream-view-container-id='scrollingElementId'></SnippylyComments>
```

</Callout>

## Customization

### Style the text-based highlighter

When a text is selected and a comment is added, the background of the selected text is set to yellow and the text color is set to black.

You can style the highlighter by passing your own CSS class name to the `text-highlighter-class` attribute of the `<SnippylyComments>` element.

**Example**

```html copy
<SnippylyComments text-highlighter-class="custom-text-highlighter-class">
</SnippylyComments>
```

```css copy
.custom-text-highlighter-class {
  background-color: lightgreen !important;
  color: black !important;
}
```
